# Oil Pipeline Accidents

## Data Description
For our final project, we are looking into presenting data based on **Oil Pipeline Accidents(Spills)** dating back from 2010 to the present. The data references the locations of the spills, the corporations that were managing the pipelines/responsible for the spills, the causes of how the accidents occurred, the total costs resulting in these spills, among other factors. Our specific data can be found in the [link](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/pipeline-accidents), provided by the US Department of Transportation. 
By looking through the data set and focusing on these key factors provided within it, we will be able to use the domain source (US Dept. of Transportation) to further our knowledge on the subject. In learning these things, we will be able to provide to our clients specific data about the oil spills that were caused by Oil Pipeline Accidents.
